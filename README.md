üêæ Object Detection with YOLOv8
This project implements YOLOv8 for object detection and classification of cats and dogs using the Oxford Pets Dataset. The framework supports training, evaluation, and inference across images, videos, and live camera streams.

üîß Tools & Frameworks
      - Python 3.10+
      - Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
      - YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
      - OpenCV
      - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
      - Scikit-learn (for dataset splitting)

üìå Project Workflow
Dataset Preparation
    - Used the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset (cats and dogs).
    - Converted annotations from XML to YOLO format.
    - Split dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%).

Model Development & Training
    - Conducted experiments with different YOLOv8 model variants and training setups:
          YOLOv8n (nano) vs YOLOv8s (small).
          30 vs 50 epochs.
          Different input resolutions (320 vs 640).

Evaluation
    - Assessed models on mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, precision, and recall.
    - Compared performance trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and resource requirements.

Inference & Visualization
    - Ran predictions on images and videos.
    - Generated visualizations of correct and incorrect detections.
    - Implemented real-time inference on custom videos.

üìä Observations
Architecture Differences
    - YOLOv8n (30 epochs): Competitive accuracy with low computational cost, suitable for lightweight deployment.
    - YOLOv8s (30 epochs): Higher accuracy but more resource-intensive, showing that larger models are not always required for acceptable performance.

Training Duration
    - YOLOv8s (50 epochs): Best overall balance of precision, recall, and mAP, making it suitable for high-accuracy applications.
    - YOLOv8s (30 epochs): Delivered strong results with shorter training time, proving that extended training is not always necessary.

Input Resolution Trade-Offs
    - YOLOv8s (30 epochs, imgsz=320): Faster training and inference, but lower recall. Recommended only where real-time speed is prioritized over accuracy.   

‚ö° Challenges
    - Training Time: Each run required hours on Colab‚Äôs free GPU tier, making experimentation difficult. This led to upgrading to Colab Pro for access to higher-performance GPUs.
    - Incorrect Predictions in Low Light: The model occasionally misclassified objects under poor lighting conditions, highlighting the need for data augmentation and robust pre-processing.
    - Resource Constraints: Larger models demanded more memory and compute power, which limited experimentation with higher architectures.
